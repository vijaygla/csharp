# Create, Compile and run csharp Project
- **Create Dotnet project**
     - dotnet new console -n MyApp
- Compile
    - `csc Program.cs` ---> convert the csharp into the FileName.exe file
    - `Program.exe` ---> This command help to run the code.
- Run
    - `dotnet run Program.cs` ---> This command help to compile and run both the code at a time.

## Entry point of csharp code
- program.cs file is the entry point in the csharp code which is present in the System namespace(package)
- all variable and method are by default private in csharp

- **every class is by default `internal` in c#** ---> means it can essible within the same project
- Entry point line can be allow only
```
static void Main()
static int Main()
static void Main(string[] args)
static int Main(string[] args)
```
##
- Must be static → So the runtime can call it without creating an object.
- Must be Main → It’s the predefined entry point recognized by the CLR.
- Return type: void or int → Void ends execution cleanly, int returns status code to the OS.

## Exicution of program in c#
```
     C# Code (.cs)
         ↓
     C# Compiler (csc / Roslyn)
         ↓
     IL Code (.exe / .dll)
         ↓
     CLR (Common Language Runtime)
         ↓
     Machine Code → Program Runs
```

## Intermediate Language (IL)
- Platform-independent code
- Generated by the C# compiler(csc or Rosyln)
- also called MSIL / CIL

## Three area in the csharp
1. Heap area
2. stack area
3. static area

- Static methods and members are associated with the class itself, initialized once when the type(blue print like class and struct) is loaded, and do not require object creation.


## Access Modifier
- public             → Accessible everywhere
- private            → Same class only
- protected          → Same class + derived class (any - project)
- internal           → Same project only
- protected internal → Same project OR derived class (any project)
- private protected  → Same class + derived class (same project only)

## Default Access Modifiers in C#
| Member Type        | Location       | Default Access Modifier |
|--------------------|----------------|--------------------------|

## Command line argumnet in csharp
```  
     int month = Convert.ToInt32(args[0]);
     int day = Convert.ToInt32(args[1]);
```
**To pass input values**
- dotnet run 3 25
- FileName.exe 3 25

## String
1. String constant pool: special area inside the heap memory Created using string literals can't exccessible so it more secure.
- string constant pool me object banta hai when we string literal
- static object ke pass 1 object banta hai to agle object ko kaise point karega
- we can't excess the constant pool area
2. what is exist in the csharp(c#)
- ❌ StringBuffer does NOT exist in C#
- ✅ StringBuilder EXISTS in C#



- Is operator in the csharp use to check wheather the object of which class
- Every class have constructor
- fully cally class name when we print the refernce and refernce address print in hexa code we cant decode
- either we can use the constructor or we can use the getter and setter
- return string ? ---> means return any types of values
- `Diamond problem`: child does not know which path i have to follow(parent1, parent2) to go to super most class (like system and object);
- diamond problem can be solve using interface instead of multiple inheritance because we can override the method in interface.
- static can be overload not override



# 📘 UML Class Diagram Notes (Aggregation)

## UML Visibility Symbols (C#)
- `+` : **public**
- `-` : **private**
- `#` : **protected**
- `~` : **internal**
- `<>` : **aggregation**
```
- class diagram 
- sequence diagram
- object modelling
```
---

## 🔹 What is Aggregation?
- Aggregation is a **"Has-A" relationship** between classes.  
- It represents a **whole-part relationship** where the part can exist independently of the whole.  
- Shown in UML with a **hollow diamond (<>--).**

---
- method having the smame signature in the overiding

- **Method hiding**: when we override the static method 
- Yes, static methods can be overloaded in C# because overloading is resolved at compile time, but they cannot be overridden.
- use virtual for the base method and use the override in case of override method
- interfcae have non concreate method
- abstract class have both concreate as well as non concrete method
- interface does not have any constructor.

## Access Modifier allow for the main class in c#
- In C#, there are two class access modifiers: `public` and `internal`.
- In C#, a nested class can have five access modifiers: `public`, `private`, `protected`, `internal`, and `protected internal`.
- `readonly: ` You need to return multiple results || To improve code safety and maintainability.

## out keyword
- use to pass the value of variable from method to caller.
- Return multiple values.
- Send data from method to caller
- Avoid creating wrapper objects or classes
- Indicate output-only parameters
- Improve performance (no extra object creation)

## OOPS 
- (Object-Oriented Programming System) is a programming approach based on objects that combine data and methods to model real-world entities.

## Encapsulation (Data Hiding)
- Wrapping data + methods into one unit (class)
- Restrict direct access using private
- Access data via properties (method like getter and setter using public access modifier)

## Inheritance (Code Reusability)
- One class acquires properties of another class
- `: symbol used`
- ex: Animal --> Dog

## Polymorphism (Many Forms)
- Same method name
- Different behavior

- **Types**:
     - Compile-time (Method Overloading)    
          - `within same class`
          - decision happen at compile time
     - Runtime (Method Overriding) 
          - `Overriding` means a child class changes the behavior of a method defined in the parent class using the same method signature.
          - `Method Hiding` means a child class creates a new method with the same name as the parent method, hiding the parent method.
               `ex: ` 
               `
                    public new void sameMethodName() {
                         Console.WriteLine("Child Show Method");
                    }
               `
          - `within different class`
          - decision happen at run time

## Constructor
- A constructor is a special method
- Same name as class
- Automatically called when object is created
- Used to initialize data

🔹 Types
- Default constructor
- Parameterized constructor
- `Static constructor`
     - Runs only once
     - Used to initialize static data
     - Cannot have parameters
- `copy constructor`: Copy Constructor is a constructor that creates a new object by copying the values of another existing object of the same class.

- `this` is used to refer to the current instance of the same class.
- `base` is used to refer to the instance of immediate parent class.
- `base()` - use to call the parent class constructor.

- `const` is used to declare constants at compile-time.
     - `ex:` const int MaxValue = 100;

- `readonly` is used to declare variables that can be assigned only once, either: at declaration, or inside the constructor.

## `Constructor chaning`
     Constructor chaining is a mechanism where one constructor calls another constructor of the same class or the base (parent) class to avoid code duplication and ensure proper initialization of objects.


##
`git fetch`: Used to get the latest changes from the remote repository without affecting your current branch or code.

`git pull`: Used to get the latest changes from the remote repository and immediately merge them into your current branch.

##
`A namespace is a logical container that organizes code and prevents naming collisions.`

## 
abstract method ---> Non cocreate method by default public + abstract
non abstract method---> Concrete method

## Loose coupling by using Interface
`ILoan loan = new HomeLoan();` so that i dont have to change the whole object;

## version 2 v-2
- IWheather api = new Google();
- IWheather api = new Microsoft();
- IWheather api = new Amazon();
- IWheather api = new Tesla();

## Next versions losse coupling
- IWheather api;
- api = new Google();
- api = new Microsoft();
- api = new Amazon();
- api = new Tesla();

## encapsulation
- Use the user data and store them inside a class which is encapsulated.


## SOLID Principle
- `S – Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)` → One class, one job (make every class and interface for a single purpose like for IUser, IPay, ICart);
- `O – Open/Closed Principle (OCP)` → Extend, don’t modify (previous things dont change)
- `L – Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)` → Child behaves like parent
- `I – Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)` → Small, focused interfaces
- `D – Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)` → Depend on interfaces, not classes (like constructor dependency injection)
---

## 
- The Main method cannot be overridden in C# because it is static.
- Static methods do not support polymorphism, so override is not allowed.
- Writing another Main method in a child class results in method hiding, not overriding.
- When multiple Main methods exist, only one is chosen as the program entry point based on project settings.
- Therefore, Main does not participate in inheritance or runtime polymorphism in C#.
- `Var data types:` all rounder data types in csharp
## 
`TryParse:-` is used to safely convert a string into another data type (like int, double, DateTime, etc.) without throwing an exception if the conversion fails.

##
**Upcasting** is an Object-Oriented Programming concept where a child class object is referenced using a parent class type.
```
// Upcasting
Animal animal = new Dog();
animal.Eat();    // Parent method
animal.Sound();  // Child method (runtime polymorphism)
// animal.Bark(); ❌ Not accessible
```
**Downcasting** is an Object-Oriented Programming concept where a parent class reference is converted back into a child class type.
```
// Upcasting
Animal animal = new Dog();    
// Downcasting (explicit)
Dog dog = (Dog)animal;   
dog.Bark();  // Child method
```

## Convertion of data types
1. **Implicite** *safe*
> byte → short → int → long → float → double

     ```
     int a = 10;
     double b = a;   // int → double (implicit)
     Console.WriteLine(b);
     ```
2. **Explicite** *unsafe*
> double → float → long → int

     ```
     double a = 10.75;
     int b = (int)a;   // double → int (explicit)
     Console.WriteLine(b);  // Output: 10
     ```


## Arcitecture use in c# coding
1. Monolithic layer
2. Model layer
3. Utlity layer (service layer) (bussiness layer)
4. data base layer
5. Controller (use in collection)
