# Generic csharp
- Generics allow you to write type-safe, reusable, and efficient code by defining placeholders for data types.
Instead of fixing a data type (int, string, etc.), you use a type parameter like T, which gets replaced at compile time.

## C# supports the following types of generics:
- Generic Class
- Generic Method
- Generic Interface
- Generic Delegate
- Generic Constraints
