# SonarQube
- SonarQube is an open-source static code analysis tool used to continuously inspect code quality.
- It analyzes your source code without running it and helps you find:
    - 🐞 Bugs
    - 🔐 Security vulnerabilities
    - 🧼 Code smells (bad practices, messy code)
    - 📊 Code coverage
    - 🔁 Duplicated code

- `Main goal`: Write clean, secure, maintainable code

## Why SonarQube is needed?
In real projects:

Code grows fast

Multiple developers commit code

Bugs & security issues sneak in

SonarQube acts like a quality gatekeeper 🛂 `before` code goes to production.


## 🔹 Real-Life Uses of SonarQube
🏢 1. Enterprise Applications

Banking systems

Insurance platforms

ERP software
👉 Prevents security breaches

🚀 2. CI/CD Pipelines

Used with:

Jenkins

GitHub Actions

Azure DevOps

`Commit → Build → SonarQube → Deploy`
`If Quality Gate ❌ fails → deployment stops.`
